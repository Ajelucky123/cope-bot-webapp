# How to Get WalletConnect Project ID - Step by Step Guide

## Quick Summary

WalletConnect Cloud is now called **Reown**. The process is the same, but the website might show "Reown" branding.

## Step 1: Go to WalletConnect Cloud / Reown

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://cloud.walletconnect.com/**
   - OR: **https://dashboard.reown.com/** (new URL)
3. You'll see the Reown/WalletConnect Cloud homepage

## Step 2: Sign Up / Log In

1. Click the **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"** button (top right)
2. You can sign up with:
   - **Email** (recommended)
   - **GitHub account**
   - **Google account**
3. If using email:
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a password
   - Verify your email (check your inbox)

## Step 3: Create a New Project

1. Once logged in, you'll see the dashboard
2. Look for:
   - **"Create New Project"** button
   - **"New Project"** button
   - **"+"** icon to create project
3. Fill in the project details:

   **Project Name:**
   ```
   COPE Referral Bot
   ```

   **Homepage URL:**
   ```
   https://ajelucky123.github.io/cope-bot-webapp/
   ```

   **Allowed Domains:**
   ```
   ajelucky123.github.io
   ```
   (This allows your GitHub Pages domain to use WalletConnect)

4. Click **"Create"** or **"Create Project"**

## Step 4: Get Your Project ID

1. After creating the project, you'll be taken to the project dashboard
2. You'll see your **Project ID** displayed prominently
3. It looks like a long string of characters (usually 32+ characters):
   ```
   a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   ```
4. Click the **copy icon** (📋) next to the Project ID to copy it

## Step 5: Share Your Project ID

Once you have your Project ID, **copy it and share it with me**. I'll update the webapp code to use WalletConnect v2.

## Where to Find Project ID

The Project ID is usually shown:
- ✅ In the project dashboard (main page after creating project)
- ✅ Under "Project Settings" or "Settings" tab
- ✅ Next to "Project ID" or "Project Key" label
- ✅ With a copy button (📋 icon) next to it

## Visual Guide

**Typical Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Project: COPE Referral Bot     │
│                                 │
│  Project ID:                    │
│  [a1b2c3d4...] [📋 Copy]       │
│                                 │
│  Homepage: https://...          │
│  Domain: ajelucky123.github.io  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find "Create Project" button?
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if you're on the dashboard page
- Look for a **"+"** icon or **"New Project"** link
- Try refreshing the page

### Project ID not showing?
- Refresh the page
- Check **"Project Settings"** or **"Settings"** tab
- Look in the sidebar or top section of the project page
- Click on your project name to view details

### Need to find it later?
1. Log in to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/ or https://dashboard.reown.com/
2. Go to **"Projects"** section
3. Click on your project name
4. Project ID will be visible there

### Website shows "Reown" instead of "WalletConnect"?
- This is normal! WalletConnect rebranded to Reown
- Everything works the same way
- Project IDs are still called "Project ID"

## Important Notes

- ✅ **Project ID is FREE** - No payment required
- ✅ **One Project ID per project** - You can create multiple projects if needed
- ✅ **Keep it secure** - Don't share publicly (but it's okay to share with me for code updates)
- ✅ **Works with all wallets** - Once updated, works with Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.

## What Happens Next?

After you share your Project ID:
1. ✅ I'll update the webapp code to use WalletConnect v2
2. ✅ Add your Project ID to the code
3. ✅ Test the implementation
4. ✅ Push the updated code
5. ✅ Your webapp will work with Trust Wallet! 🎉
